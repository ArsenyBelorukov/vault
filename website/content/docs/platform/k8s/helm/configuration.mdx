# Configuration

@include 'helm/version.mdx'

The chart is highly customizable using
[Helm configuration values](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).
Each value has a default tuned for an optimal getting started experience
with Vault. Before going into production, please review the parameters below
and consider if they're appropriate for your deployment.

<!-- codegen: start -->

## global

- `global` - These global values affect multiple components of the chart.

  - `enabled` (`boolean: true`) - The global enabled/disabled configuration. If this is true, most components will be installed by default. If this is false, no components will be installed by default and manually opting-in is required, such as by setting `server.enabled` to true.

  - `imagePullSecrets` (`array: []`) - References secrets to be used when pulling images from private registries. See [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) for more details. May be specified as an array of name map entries or just as an array of names:

    ```yaml
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: image-pull-secret
    # or
    imagePullSecrets:
      - image-pull-secret
    ```

  - `tlsDisable` (`boolean: true`) - When set to `true`, changes URLs from `https` to `http` (such as the `VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200` environment variable set on the Vault pods).

  - `externalVaultAddr` (`string: ""`) - External vault server address for the injector and CSI provider to use. Setting this will disable deployment of a vault server. A service account with token review permissions is automatically created if `server.serviceAccount.create=true` is set for the external Vault server to use.

  - `openshift` (`boolean: false`) - If `true`, enables configuration specific to OpenShift such as NetworkPolicy, SecurityContext, and Route.

  - `psp` - Values that configure Pod Security Policy.

    - `enable` (`boolean: false`) - When set to `true`, enables Pod Security Policies for Vault and Vault Agent Injector.

    - `annotations` (`string`) - This value defines additional annotations to add to the Pod Security Policies. This can either be YAML or a YAML-formatted multi-line templated string.

      ```yaml
      annotations:
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default,runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName:  runtime/default
      # or
      annotations: |

    - `tag` (`string: "1.2.1"`) - The tag of the Docker image for the Vault Agent Injector. **This should be pinned to a specific version when running in production.** Otherwise, other changes to the chart may inadvertently upgrade your admission controller.

    - `pullPolicy` (`string: "IfNotPresent"`) - The pull policy for container images. The default pull policy is `IfNotPresent` which causes the Kubelet to skip pulling an image if it already exists.

  - `agentImage` - Values that configure the Vault Agent sidecar image.

    - `repository` (`string: "hashicorp/vault"`) - The name of the Docker image for the Vault Agent sidecar. This should be set to the official Vault Docker image.

          - ALL
      ```

  - `resources` (`dictionary: {}`) - The resource requests and limits (CPU, memory, etc.) for each container of the injector. This should be a YAML dictionary of a Kubernetes [ResourceRequirements](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.24/#resourcerequirements-v1-core) object. If this isn't specified, then the pods won't request any specific amount of resources, which limits the ability for Kubernetes to make efficient use of compute resources.
 **Setting this is highly recommended.**

    ```yaml
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: '256Mi'
        cpu: '250m'
      limits:

    ```

  - `webhook` - Values that control the Mutating Webhook Configuration.

    - `failurePolicy` (`string: "Ignore"`) - Configures failurePolicy of the webhook. To block pod creation while the webhook is unavailable, set the policy to `"Fail"`. See [Failure Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#failure-policy).

    - `matchPolicy` (`string: "Exact"`) - Specifies the approach to accepting changes based on the rules of the MutatingWebhookConfiguration. See [Match Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#matching-requests-matchpolicy).

    - `timeoutSeconds` (`int: 30`) - Specifies the number of seconds before the webhook request will be ignored or fails. If it is ignored or fails depends on the `failurePolicy`. See [timeouts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#timeouts).

    - `namespaceSelector` (`object: {}`) - The selector used by the admission webhook controller to limit what namespaces where injection can happen. If unset, all non-system namespaces are eligible for injection. See [Matching requests: namespace selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#matching-requests-namespaceselector).

      ```yaml
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          sidecar-injector: enabled
      ```

    - `objectSelector` (`object: {}`) - The selector used by the admission webhook controller to limit what objects can be affected by mutation. See [Matching requests: object selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#matching-requests-objectselector).

    ```

  - `certs` - The certs section configures how the webhook TLS certs are configured. These are the TLS certs for the Kube apiserver communicating to the webhook. By default, the injector will generate and manage its own certs, but this requires the ability for the injector to update its own `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`. In a production environment, custom certs should probably be used. Configure the values below to enable this.

    - `secretName` (`string: ""`) - secretName is the name of the Kubernetes secret that has the TLS certificate and private key to serve the injector webhook. If this is null, then the injector will default to its automatic management mode.

    - `caBundle` (`string: ""`) - The PEM-encoded CA public certificate bundle for the TLS certificate served by the injector. This must be specified as a string and can't come from a secret because it must be statically configured on the Kubernetes `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` resource. This only needs to be specified if `secretName` is not null.

    - `certName` (`string: "tls.crt"`) - The name of the certificate file within the `secretName` secret.

    - `keyName` (`string: "tls.key"`) - The name of the key file within the `secretName` secret.

      AGENT_INJECT_TLS_MIN_VERSION: tls13
      AGENT_INJECT_TLS_CIPHER_SUITES: ...
    ```

  - `affinity` (`string or dictionary`) - This value defines the [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) for Vault Agent Injector pods. This can either be multi-line string or YAML matching the PodSpec's affinity field. It defaults to allowing only a single pod on each node, which minimizes risk of the cluster becoming unusable if a node is lost. If you need to run more pods per node (for example, testing on Minikube), set this value to `null`.

    ```yaml
    # Recommended default server affinity:
    affinity: |
      podAntiAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:

    # or
    annotations: |
      "sample/annotation1": "foo"
      "sample/annotation2": "bar"
    ```

  - `extraArgs` (`array: []`) - Pass arbitrary additional arguments to vault-csi-provider. See /vault/docs/platform/k8s/csi/configurations#command-line-arguments for the available command line flags.

## serverTelemetry

- `serverTelemetry` - Vault is able to collect and publish various runtime metrics. Enabling this feature requires setting adding `telemetry{}` stanza to the Vault configuration. There are a few examples included in the `config` sections above.
 For more information see: /vault/docs/configuration/telemetry /vault/docs/internals/telemetry

  - `serviceMonitor` - Enable support for the Prometheus Operator. Currently, this chart does not support authenticating to Vault's metrics endpoint, so the following `telemetry{}` must be included in the `listener "tcp"{}` stanza  telemetry {    unauthenticated_metrics_access = "true"  }
 See the `standalone.config` for a more complete example of this.
 In addition, a top level `telemetry{}` stanza must also be included in the Vault configuration:
 example:  telemetry {    prometheus_retention_time = "30s"    disable_hostname = true  }
 Configuration for monitoring the Vault server.

    - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) - The Prometheus operator *must* be installed before enabling this feature, if not the chart will fail to install due to missing CustomResourceDefinitions provided by the operator.
 Instructions on how to install the Helm chart can be found here:  https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack More information can be found here:  https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator  https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus
 Enable deployment of the Vault Server ServiceMonitor CustomResource.

    - `selectors` (`dictionary: {}`) - Selector labels to add to the ServiceMonitor. When empty, defaults to:  release: prometheus

    - `interval` (`string: "30s"`) - Interval at which Prometheus scrapes metrics

    - `scrapeTimeout` (`string: "10s"`) - Timeout for Prometheus scrapes

  - `prometheusRules`

      - `enabled` (`boolean: false`) - The Prometheus operator *must* be installed before enabling this feature, if not the chart will fail to install due to missing CustomResourceDefinitions provided by the operator.
 Deploy the PrometheusRule custom resource for AlertManager based alerts. Requires that AlertManager is properly deployed.

      - `selectors` (`dictionary: {}`) - Selector labels to add to the PrometheusRules. When empty, defaults to:  release: prometheus

      - `rules` (`dictionary: {}`) - Some example rules.
